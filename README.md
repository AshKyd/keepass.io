*keepass.io* is a Node.js library for reading and writing KeePass databases. Please note that currently only the newest database version, called KDBX, is supported. Features include so far:

- **Password and/or Keyfile credentials**: keepass.io supports both of the most common used credential types for KeePass databases.
- **Powerful API**: This library offers you a powerful API, which even allows you raw access to the database, so even unsupported third-party fields can be modified.
- **Joyfully simple and flexible**: I've built keepass.io to be easily understandable and a joy to use. It's built with JavaScript and tries to provide a solid foundation for modifying KDBX databases.

-
**Note**: *keepass.io is currently under active development. As such, while this library is well-tested, the API might change at anytime. Consider using it in production applications only if you're comfortable following a changelog and updating your usage accordingly.*
